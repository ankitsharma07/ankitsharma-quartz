title: An Engineer's Musings
---

Hi, I am Ankit aka nezubn [ipa nezubn /nɛzʌb/ — no meaning, i made it up] on the internet.
_an engineer, a polymath_

I am an ML engineer, a polymath, and a writer. I love to write about my experiences and share my knowledge with others. I also enjoy exploring engineering concepts and sharing my insights with others.

Currently, my brain is fixated with ML systems, databases, distributed systems and iOS development.
