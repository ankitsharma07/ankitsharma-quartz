title: An Engineer's Musings
---

Hi, I am Ankit aka nezubn [*ipa **nezubn /nɛzʌb/** — no meaning, i made it up*] on the internet. <br>
_an engineer, a polymath_

I am an ML engineer, a polymath, and a writer. I love to write about my experiences and share my knowledge with others. I also enjoy exploring engineering concepts and sharing my insights with others.

Currently, my brain is fixated with ML systems, databases, distributed systems and iOS/macOS development. I try to keep a tab on what I am reading, be it a book [[bookshelf]] or a paper [[papershelf]]

I live in emacs (my choice of code editor and my interface to git), my [terminal](https://ghostty.org) and [zed](https://zed.dev). These 3 keep revolving around wherever I go. Xcode keeps coming in between every once in a while. 

You can reach out to me at: [email](mailto://ankit@nezubn.com).
