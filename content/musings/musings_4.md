The summer is finally coming to its end. The days are getting a little less warmer now. To be honest, I despise the heat. In India, it gets extremely hot here in New Delhi. 
I redesigned my website by the way. Now, there is search. There is graph, that way I can write connected notes/essays. There exists some bug here and there but, I guess I will figure them out eventually.

I have configured it on Cloudflare Pages this time. Last time, it was hosted on Github Pages. So, I decided to try something different. The search has been significantly improved and it will be helpful as I write more.

- We have a new term coined in the field of ML/AI, "context engineering". I was listening to this [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/latent-space-the-ai-engineer-podcast/id1674008350?i=1000722703162 "
") on CE.
- Deepseek had used GRPO in the R1 model that they released few months back. I was reading on why does [GRPO](https://kalomaze.bearblog.dev/why-does-grpo-work/) works.
- OpenAI finally released an open source model: [finetuning with gpt-oss](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/fine-tune-transfomers)
- Some, thoughts on GPT-OSS model:
  + sliding window attention (ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860)
  + mixture of experts (ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961)
  + RoPE w/ Yarn (ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071)
  + attention sinks (ref: streaming llm https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453)
- Folks at Deepmind released this amazing book with several chapters on [scaling LLMs](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/index).
- Found this amazing playlist on [backend systems](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui3EUkuMTPgZcV0QhQrOcwMPcBCcd_Q1&si=nzNN0G5cWtg1mMCm) created using first principles. 
- A good read on [system design](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design/)
- Some time back read about [CPU](https://cpu.land) in detail
- This is really cool [HPC](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/courses/cs639-s20/) stuff on the internet, if you are into this then [algorithms for the  modern hardware](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) is a must.
