Oh man, did I skip a beat or what? I had thought that I would be regular in
writing these but I have been shit lately. Let's forget what happened and give
it a fresh start. From now on, biweekly musings are going out. Like really going
out no matter what.

Last few months escalated quickly. I went to visit my Grandmother in my
hometown, completed some of the most extensive work at work. And last week few
weeks have been havoc in the field of Machine Learning. Google is killing it
right now. OpenAI announced Codex, io, 4.1 Software Engineer. Then Anthropic
announced Opus 4 and Sonnet 4. Sonnet 3.7 would do a lot of extra even without
asking. Claude Code, Jules and Codex are here. It's been tough keeping up with
all these tools.
