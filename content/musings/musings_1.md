title: Musings #1

It's been a while since I have acquired this domain and thought about consistent
writing. But, I kept procrastinating. I always felt what exactly should I write,
and as I am queering my career in tech, I have plenty to express and write about
now. This is a new series where I will narrate bi-weekly rants, podcasts I
heard, books I read, videos I watched on youtube or something I found extremely
helpful that I am bound to share with everyone.

The start of the year has been fantastic, at work I was stuck at this map
application where we wanted to give an offline feature where users could
navigate and fill forms without any network connection. It is coming to life
now. Everything seems to work end to end. I used flutter for creating the
android application. Then, I always wanted to read about Bloom filters which I
call as efficient set. so, I started my 2025 with reading into Bloom Filters. I
watched [Arpit Bhayani's](https://youtu.be/UVFnabieyzc) video on Bloom Filters.

-   I found this [compiler writing journey](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj?tab=readme-ov-file) which I am following now to write and
    understand compilers from first principles.
-   Read this amazing explanation on [Bloom Filters](https://samwho.dev/bloom-filters/).
-   I was going through my system design notes and then this article struck me on
    deciding [leader](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/leader-election-in-distributed-systems/) using leader election in distributed systems.
-   These [facts](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/) were profound and amazingly put by Avinash on sqlite.
-   Currently, I am reading the article on [Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html). Chip Huyen did her piece
    recently and I am a big fan of her writing.
