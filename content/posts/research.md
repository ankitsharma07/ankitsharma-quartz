There is plethora of research happening all around us and in the recent times
the incoming number of research papers have increased by quite a number.

This raises a question on how to find a good paper and give it a read.


These are some of my techniques which I use to find good papers to read in the
field of AI/ML, Databases, Distributed Systems, Algorithms.

1.  Google Scholar <br />

    You can search for any topic or author and you get a list in few
    milliseconds. The list is sorted by some ranking and you can usually find a
    good paper to read for any topic `xyz` in the top 5 search results.

2.  Hackernews <br />

    Hackernews is absolute best place to hangout if you want to discuss on
    engineering and other aspects as there are plenty of engineers hurling out
    their opinion on the website, recently, someone made this search engine for
    hackernews posts which is a semantic search: <https://hackersearch.net/>

3.  Social Media <br />

    On X (previously twitter), people like [Aran Komatsuzaki](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki) and [AK](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq) keep sharing
    good papers on their feed.

4.  [Huggingface Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers) <br />

    A collection project started by huggingface is a good place to find some
    great papers.

I have started reading more papers as I progress through my learning and these
are some of the best methods through which I find on what to read.
